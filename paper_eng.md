### Abstract
This paper presents the Information-Phase Resonance Theory (IPRT), an ontological model postulating a dynamic information field as the primary entity of reality. Matter and mind are interpreted as stable resonance states of this field, formed through phase and spectral alignment.

### 1. Introduction
Modern philosophy of mind and theoretical physics face fundamental difficulties in explaining the nature of matter, consciousness, and their interrelation. IPRT offers an alternative framework where the primary substance is not matter or energy in the classical sense, but a dynamic information field.

### 2. Theoretical Foundations
**Axiom 1 (Dynamism):** The information field is in a state of continuous high-frequency dynamics, characterized by oscillatory processes of various amplitudes and frequencies.

**Axiom 2 (Interference):** Interaction of oscillatory processes in the information field through interference leads to the formation of local stable patterns — resonance nodes.

**Axiom 3 (Materialization):** Matter represents the result of a phase transition of information dynamics into a mode of low-frequency stationary states, manifesting as standing waves in the information field.

### 3. Formal Model
The degree of organization (L) is characterized by:

$$L(t) = \int_0^t [I_{in}(\tau) - S_e(\tau)] \, d\tau$$

Where:
* $I_{in}$ — structured information inflow.
* $S_e$ — environmental entropy.
* $L(t)$ — accumulated level of organization.
