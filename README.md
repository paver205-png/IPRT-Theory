# IPRT-Theory
Formalization of the Information-Phase Resonance Theory (IPRT). This project presents a new ontological model where the information field is the primary entity, and matter and mind are emergent resonance states. It explores the interaction between structural complexity and entropy through the lens of phase transitions in informational dynamics.
