# Information-Phase Resonance Theory (IPRT)

Official repository for the **Information-Phase Resonance Theory (IPRT)** — a new ontological framework exploring the relationship between the fundamental information field, matter, and consciousness.

## Overview
This project formalizes the concept of reality as a dynamic informational system where:
- **Matter** is a low-frequency phase of information.
- **Mind** is a resonance between the material node and the field.
- **Entropy** is the primary force of dissolution that "Creative Reason" must counter.
